# Packages for Logistics regression

The package must contain the basic functions to perform logistic regression (e.g. estimate the coefficient vector Î²

which includes the independent variables/predictors plus the intercept) and obtain different outputs from the procedure. The estimator to be computed using numerical optimization is the following:

$$
\hat{\beta} := \arg\min_\beta \sum_{i=1}^n \left( -y_i \cdot \ln(p_i) - (1 - y_i) \cdot \ln(1 - p_i) \right),
$$
where
$$
p_i := \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-x_i^T \beta)},
$$
and $y_i$ and $x_i$ represent the \( i \)-th observation and row of the response and the predictors respectively.

The package is specifically designed to perform logistic regression using numerical optimization techniques. This package offers a suite of essential functions that enable users to execute logistic regression analysis and extract various key outputs from the process. The core functionalities include:

    Calculation of Initial Values for Optimization: Leveraging the least-squares method to provide starting points for the logistic regression optimization process.
    Bootstrap Confidence Intervals: Functionality to generate bootstrap samples and calculate confidence intervals, enhancing the robustness of the regression analysis.
    Logistic Curve Plotting: Tools to visualize the logistic regression curve, offering intuitive insights into the relationship between variables.
    Confusion Matrix Generation: Enables the construction of a confusion matrix, which is pivotal in evaluating the performance of the logistic regression model.
    Performance Metrics Computation: The package computes a range of performance metrics critical for assessing the efficacy of the logistic model. These include:
        Prevalence: Measures the proportion of the response variable in the dataset.
        Accuracy: Quantifies the overall correctness of the model.
        Sensitivity: Assesses the model's ability to correctly identify true positives.
        Specificity: Evaluates the model's accuracy in identifying true negatives.
        False Discovery Rate: Determines the proportion of false positives in the predicted positives.
        Diagnostic Odds Ratio: Offers a measure of the effectiveness of the logistic regression model.
